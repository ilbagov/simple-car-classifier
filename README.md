# simple-car-classifier
 A simple fastai-based model which classifies car brands, as well as a simple Binder  app which accompanies it.
 Should be run in Google Colab because of the intensive model training routine and some errors which appear in the newest fastai version (but not in Colab).
 Programmed as an intro to the fastai Deep Learning for Coders course. 
 Model performance is subpar as the repository is intended as a general intro to fastai. Further model optimization should be done.
